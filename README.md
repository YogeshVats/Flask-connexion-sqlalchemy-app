# Flask-connexion-sqlalchemy-app

#### In this app we are utilizing the Python's Flask framework with a wrapper around it, that is connexion, and SQLAlchemy module.
#### I have used API first approach to API creation, that's why OpenAPI is used to document, validate input parameters and output schema of the APIs.
<p> In this Project we will start from scratch and then will move to refine the code as we go on with the session. Code traces can be seen from the commits.

## Happy APIying ...
