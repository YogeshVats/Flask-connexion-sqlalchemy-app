# Flask-connexion-sqlalchemy-app

#### In this app we are utilizing the Python's Flask framework with a wrapper around it, that is connexion, and SQLAlchemy module.
#### I have used API first approach to API creation, that's why OpenAPI is used to document, validate input parameters and output schema of the APIs.
<p> In this Project we will start from scratch and then will move to refine the code as we go on with the session. Code traces can be seen from the commits.

## First Part
<p> In the first part of this tutorial series, you’ll learn how to:

<li> Build a base Flask project with a REST API
<li> Handle HTTP requests with Connexion
<li> Define API endpoints using the OpenAPI specification
<li> Interact with your API to manage data
<li> Build API documentation with Swagger UI

## Second Part
<p> In the second part of this tutorial series, you’ll learn how to:</p>

<li> Write SQL commands in Python
<li> Configure a SQLite database for your Flask project
<li> Use SQLAlchemy to save Python objects to your database
<li> Leverage the Marshmallow library to serialize data
<li> Connect your REST API with your database

  
## Third Part
<p> In the third part of this tutorial series, you’ll learn how to:
  
<li> Work with multiple tables in a database
<li> Create one-to-many fields in your database
<li> Manage relationships with SQLAlchemy
<li> Leverage nested schemas with Marshmallow
<li> Display related objects in the front end
